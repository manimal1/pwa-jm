This is a Progressive Web App I buit with React in order to showcase my experience as a Frontend Web Developer.  It is free for all to use as they please.  Clone it and build your own.

## Install and Run

- ```npm install```
- ```npm start```

## Run Tests

```npm test```

Tests were built with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

## Swap out content

You can swap out any content by changing it in the ```./src/data.js``` file.  The logos and images will have to be swapped out in the actual React components as well.

## Styling

I kept it bare bones and minimalistic, so I only used pure CSS (I usually employ Sass for larger projects).  I did use Bootstrap's grid system in one or two components, but since this is all I used I did not download anything else from Bootstrap (no other CSS and no JS whatsoever) to keep the file sizes down and load speeds fast.
